## Overview
**Vel-Kural** is an AI-driven framework designed to interpret and generalize the classical *Thirukkural* texts using advanced generative AI, knowledge embeddings, and multi-agent orchestration. Leveraging structured embeddings and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), Vel-Kural can understand, expand, and contextualize Kurals to generate semantically coherent interpretations and thematic extensions.

This repository demonstrates the integration of:
- **Multi-agent orchestration** for hierarchical reasoning and task delegation
- **Transformers and LLMs** for natural language understanding and generation
- **Vector embeddings and RAG pipelines** for structured knowledge retrieval

Vel-Kural is built to be extensible and applicable to educational tools, digital humanities research, and AI-assisted literature analysis.

## Features
- **Hierarchical Knowledge Retrieval:** Efficiently retrieves relevant Kurals and related knowledge from structured datasets using vector embeddings.  
- **Multi-Agent Reasoning:** Agents handle tasks like semantic interpretation, thematic classification, and content generation.  
- **Generative AI Integration:** Uses transformer-based models and LLMs to generate contextually coherent explanations and thematic expansions.  
- **Custom Knowledge Augmentation:** Allows training on additional datasets while maintaining semantic fidelity and interpretability.  
- **Explainable Outputs:** Incorporates reasoning steps to improve transparency and facilitate research insights.
